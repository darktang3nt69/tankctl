      "taskTitle": "Setup Docker Environment with TimescaleDB",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the TimescaleDB Docker setup into specific configuration steps including: 1) Docker Compose file creation with TimescaleDB image, 2) Environment variable configuration, 3) Volume setup for data persistence, and 4) Initialization script development",
      "reasoning": "Setting up TimescaleDB with Docker involves multiple configuration steps that are well-documented but require careful implementation. The task involves Docker configuration, environment variables, persistent storage, and initialization scripts - all moderately complex but straightforward with available documentation."

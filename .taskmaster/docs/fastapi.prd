This section details the specific requirements for each improvement area.

2.1 API Documentation Enhancement

Goal: Improve the clarity and completeness of the automatically generated OpenAPI (Swagger UI) documentation and inline code documentation for API endpoints.

•
Requirement 2.1.1: Enhance Endpoint Docstrings

•
Description: Review and enhance the docstrings for every API endpoint function within the app/api/v1/ routers (admin_command_router.py, command_router.py, override_router.py, register_router.py, settings_router.py, status_router.py).

•
Details: Docstrings should clearly explain the purpose of the endpoint, the expected inputs, the processing logic (at a high level), and the outputs. Use Markdown formatting within docstrings for better readability in generated documentation.



•
Requirement 2.1.2: Add Request/Response Examples to OpenAPI Docs

•
Description: Utilize FastAPI's capabilities (Body, openapi_examples) to include realistic examples of request bodies and expected response bodies (both success and error cases) in the OpenAPI documentation for each endpoint.

•
Details: Examples should cover typical use cases and demonstrate the expected data structures clearly.



•
Requirement 2.1.3: Standardize Error Response Documentation

•
Description: Explicitly document the possible HTTP error responses (e.g., 400, 401, 403, 404, 500) for each endpoint using FastAPI's responses parameter in the route decorator.

•
Details: For each documented error status code, provide a brief description of the condition that triggers it and reference the standard error response schema (to be defined in Requirement 2.2.2).



•
Requirement 2.1.4: Detail Parameter Descriptions

•
Description: Ensure all path parameters, query parameters, and request body fields have clear and concise descriptions within the Pydantic models (app/schemas/) and endpoint function signatures.

•
Details: Descriptions should clarify the purpose, expected format, and any constraints for each parameter or field.



2.2 Error Handling Standardization

Goal: Implement a consistent and informative error handling mechanism across the entire API to improve robustness and provide clearer feedback to clients.

•
Requirement 2.2.1: Implement a Centralized Error Handling Utility

•
Description: Create custom exception classes for specific application errors (e.g., TankNotFoundError, InvalidCommandError, DatabaseError). Implement FastAPI exception handlers to catch these custom exceptions and standard FastAPI/HTTP exceptions.

•
Details: Centralize exception handling logic (e.g., in app/core/exceptions.py and app/main.py or dedicated handlers) to avoid repetitive try-except blocks in endpoint logic. The handlers should log the error appropriately and return a standardized error response.



•
Requirement 2.2.2: Define and Use Standard Error Response Formats

•
Description: Define a standard Pydantic schema for error responses (e.g., ErrorResponse in app/schemas/errors.py). This schema should include fields like detail (user-friendly message), error_code (machine-readable code, see 2.2.4), and potentially timestamp or request_id.

•
Details: All API error responses, whether generated by custom handlers or FastAPI defaults, should conform to this standard schema.



•
Requirement 2.2.3: Implement Consistent Error Reporting Across Endpoints

•
Description: Ensure all API endpoints consistently raise appropriate exceptions (custom or standard) when errors occur, relying on the centralized handlers (Req 2.2.1) to generate the response.

•
Details: Remove direct returning of HTTPException from deep within service layers where possible; prefer raising custom exceptions that map to appropriate HTTP statuses in the handlers.



•
Requirement 2.2.4: Introduce Granular Error Codes

•
Description: Define a set of unique, machine-readable error codes (e.g., TANK_NOT_FOUND, INVALID_INPUT, AUTH_ERROR) corresponding to specific error conditions.

•
Details: Include these error codes in the standardized error response schema (Req 2.2.2). Maintain a central registry or enum for these codes (e.g., in app/core/error_codes.py).



2.3 Input Validation Improvements

Goal: Strengthen input validation to prevent invalid data from entering the system and provide clear feedback on validation failures.

•
Requirement 2.3.1: Add Comprehensive Validation Rules to Pydantic Schemas

•
Description: Review all Pydantic schemas in app/schemas/ and enhance them with more specific validation rules using Pydantic validators (@validator) or libraries like email-validator where appropriate.

•
Details: Examples include validating string lengths, numerical ranges, enum values, email formats, URL formats, and specific patterns (e.g., for tank names or IDs if applicable).



•
Requirement 2.3.2: Implement Custom Validators Where Needed

•
Description: For complex business rules that cannot be expressed with standard Pydantic validators, implement custom validation logic within the schemas or service layer.

•
Details: Ensure custom validators raise clear ValueError or custom validation exceptions that can be handled appropriately.



•
Requirement 2.3.3: Add Validation for Edge Cases

•
Description: Explicitly consider and add validation for potential edge cases, such as empty inputs, null values (where not allowed), boundary values for numerical ranges, and potentially malicious inputs.



•
Requirement 2.3.4: Ensure Consistent Validation Error Messages

•
Description: Ensure that validation errors raised by Pydantic or custom validators result in consistent, user-friendly error messages formatted according to the standard error response schema (Req 2.2.2).

•
Details: FastAPI typically handles Pydantic validation errors well, but review the generated messages for clarity and consistency.

•
Requirement 2.4.4: Add References to External Documentation Where Applicable

•
Description: Where code interacts with external services, libraries, or protocols with relevant external documentation, add comments referencing that documentation (e.g., links to library docs, RFCs).



2.5 Configuration Management

Goal: Improve the robustness and clarity of application configuration.

•
Requirement 2.5.1: Add Startup Validation for Required Environment Variables

•
Description: Implement a check at application startup (e.g., in app/core/config.py or app/main.py) that verifies the presence and, where possible, the basic validity (e.g., format) of all required environment variables (as listed in the README and .env.example).
